# 🚉 Railways Management System
📌 Overview

The Railways Management System is a database-driven project designed to manage and analyze operations within the Indian Railways. It integrates SQL database design, query operations, and Power BI visualization to streamline railway operations such as passenger bookings, employee assignments, train scheduling, and revenue analysis.

🎯 Key Features

1.Database Schema (SQL):
Stations, Trains, Employees, Passengers, Tickets, Timetables, Cancellations, Seat Availability.

2.Core Functionalities:
Passenger and ticket management (booking, cancellation, fare details).
Train operations and scheduling with platform/time conflict detection.
Employee assignment and salary analysis across stations.
Revenue insights and seat availability tracking.

3.Analytical Queries:
Aggregations (total passengers, average fares, total revenue).
Joins for mapping passengers, tickets, employees, and trains.
Subqueries for identifying high-revenue trains and frequent passengers.
Window functions for ranking trains, employees, and fares.
Views for simplified reporting (TrainRevenue, EmployeeStation, TravelHistory).
Indexing for faster search and optimization.

4.Power BI Dashboard:
Interactive visualization of bookings, revenue, passenger demographics, and station coverage.

🛠️ Tech Stack

1.Database: PostgreSQL / SQL

2.Visualization: Power BI

3.Languages Used: SQL (DDL, DML, Views, Indexing, Analytical Queries)

4.File Types: .sql (Schema + Operations), .pbix (Dashboard)
